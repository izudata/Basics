Explanation of the Code
select(orderid, orderdate, shipcountry): Selects the specified columns from your data frame.

filter(shipcountry %in% c("Brazil", "France", "USA")): Filters the data to include only the rows where shipcountry matches one of the specified countries.

arrange(orderdate): This arranges the filtered data in ascending order based on the orderdate column. If you want to sort by a different column, just replace orderdate with the desired column name.

view(): Opens a viewer window in RStudio to display the resulting data frame.

Additional Sorting Options
Descending Order: If you want to sort in descending order, you can use the desc() function:

rcode
arrange(desc(orderdate))
